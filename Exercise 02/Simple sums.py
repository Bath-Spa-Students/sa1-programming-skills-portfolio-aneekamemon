# Exercise 2: Simple Sums

# Declare a variable and initialize it with the integer value '8'.

first_number = (8)

# Declare a second variable and initialize it with the integer value '10'.

second_number = (10)

# Declare a third variable that stores the sum of the initial 2 numbers. 

sum_of_the_numbers = (first_number + second_number)

# Print the value of the sum to the console. 

print (int(sum_of_the_numbers), ("Is the sum of the first and second number."))
