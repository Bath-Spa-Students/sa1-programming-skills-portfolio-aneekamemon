# Simple Search 

'''

Write a program that searches for a specific string within a list of strings. The list
is initialized with specific names (“Jake” “Zac”, “Ian”, “Ron”, “Sam”, “Dave”).
, and your task is to search for “Sam”.
# This has been copied from the exercise sheet.

'''

# Define the list filled with the 6 string names. 

names = ["Jake", "Zac", "Ian", "Ron", "Sam", "Dave"]   

NAME = ("Sam")  # In this case we have to search for the name "Sam".

if NAME in names:   # If the name 'Sam' is in the list
    print (f"The name '{NAME}' is on the list!") # This is what will be printed out.
else:
        # If the name 'Sam' is not found, this will print out.
    print (f"The name '{NAME}' is NOT on the list... ")
