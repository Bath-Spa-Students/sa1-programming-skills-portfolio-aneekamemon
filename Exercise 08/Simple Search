# Simple Search 

'''

Write a program that searches for a specific string within a list of strings. The list
is initialized with specific names (“Jake” “Zac”, “Ian”, “Ron”, “Sam”, “Dave”).
, and your task is to search for “Sam”.
# This has been copied from the exercise sheet.

'''

# Define the list filled with the 6 string names. 

names = ["Jake", "Zac", "Ian", "Ron", "Sam", "Dave"]

NAME = ("Sam")

specific_name_search = input("Enter the name you'd like to search for: ").strip().lower().upper() # This allows the user to type the name they are looking for, irrespective capitalization or lowercase lettering. 

found = False   # Tracks whether or not the name has been found



for NAME in names: # Loop checks if each name matches user input. 
    if specific_name_search.lower() == NAME.lower():    
        found = True    # When a match in names is discovered 

        print (f"The name {specific_name_search.lower()} is on the list!") # This is what will be printed out.
        break   # Exit the loop, because the name has been found..
if not found: # If the name is not found, this will print out.
    print (f"The name '{specific_name_search.lower()}' is NOT on the list... ")
