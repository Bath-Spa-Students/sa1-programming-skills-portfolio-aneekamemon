# Coding is cool 

# Assigning the word 'coding' to the variable 'word1'
word1 = "coding"

# Assigning the word 'is' to the variable 'word2'
word2 = "is"

# Assigning the word 'cool' to the variable 'word3'
word3 = "cool"

# Combine the variables through string concentration with spaces between them.

print (word1 + " " + word2 + " " + word3) 

 # Which will print the result 'coding is cool' in the terminal.
